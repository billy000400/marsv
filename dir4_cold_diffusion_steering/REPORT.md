# ColdSteer — on-manifold correction for activation steering

> Final, presentable, current-best only (history in CHANGELOG.md).

## Summary

**Activation steering** is a popular way to control a language model's behavior at
inference time: you find a direction `v` in the model's hidden state that corresponds to a
concept (say, "positive sentiment"), then add `α·v` to the activations as the model runs,
where `α` sets the strength. The problem is that pushing hard on `α` drags the activation
away from the region of activations the model actually produces on real text — it goes
**off-manifold** — and the model's fluency collapses.

This direction asks whether a small learned **corrector** can preserve the intended
steering effect while pulling the activation back onto the manifold. This report covers the
first step: **quantifying the failure mode itself.** Using GPT-2 small and a sentiment
steering direction, we show that as steering strength `α` grows, the steered activation
moves monotonically off-manifold by three independent measures, and the model's language
modeling loss degrades by up to +2.78 nats (≈16× perplexity). This establishes both the
problem and the metrics that a corrector will later be judged against.

## Methods

### Data & Model

**Model.** GPT-2 small (124M parameters), via HuggingFace `transformers`. We hook the
**residual stream after block 6** (`resid_post`, the middle of GPT-2's 12 blocks), a 768-dim
vector per token. In HuggingFace terms this is `hidden_states[7]` (index `layer+1`, since
`hidden_states[0]` is the embedding).

**Text data.** FineWeb documents (a large open web-text corpus). We fit activation
statistics on **49,218 token activations** from 400 documents (128 tokens each) and measure
LM degradation on a **held-out 100 documents**.

**Steering vector.** A **DiffMean** sentiment direction: mean activation over 20 clearly
positive sentences minus mean activation over 20 matched negative sentences, at block 6.
It is used in **raw activation units** (not renormalized), giving `|v| = 11.1`; for
reference the mean clean-activation norm is `|h| = 112.2`. Steering strength `α` is therefore
in multiples of one "natural sentiment shift." We form the steered activation for a clean
activation `h`:

```math
z = h + \alpha\, v
```

and sweep `α ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}`.

### Metrics

All three metrics measure how far steering pushes the activation off the real-text
manifold; **higher = more off-manifold / more damage** for all three.

**Mahalanobis distance `D_M`** — distance from the steered activation to the cloud of real
activations, fit as a single Gaussian with mean `μ` and covariance `Σ` (estimated on the
49,218 clean tokens, with a small ridge `10⁻³·I` added to `Σ` for invertibility). It counts
how many standard deviations, in the whitened activation space, the point sits from typical
activations:

```math
D_M(x) = \sqrt{(x-\mu)^{\top}\, \Sigma^{-1}\, (x-\mu)}
```

We report the mean `D_M` over a 20,000-token sample. The reference value for **real
activations** is `D_M = 27.3`; a steered activation scoring well above this is off-manifold.

**Norm inflation ratio** — how much steering blows up the activation's length relative to a
clean activation:

```math
\rho(\alpha) = \frac{\mathbb{E}\,\lVert z \rVert}{\mathbb{E}\,\lVert h \rVert}
```

A value of 1 means the steered activation has a typical length; `ρ > 1` means it is
abnormally large.

**Δ LM loss** — the practical cost of steering. We patch `z = h + α·v` into `resid_post` at
block 6 for **every token position** during a forward pass and measure the mean next-token
cross-entropy (natural log), then subtract the unsteered baseline `α = 0`:

```math
\Delta\mathrm{LM}(\alpha) = \mathrm{CE}_{\text{next-token}}(z=h+\alpha v)\; -\; \mathrm{CE}_{\text{next-token}}(z=h)
```

`ΔLM` is in nats; `+ln(k)` nats means perplexity got `k×` worse. Larger = more fluency
damage.

### Baselines

This first experiment has no learned method yet — it characterizes the phenomenon. The
**reference points** are:

- **Unsteered activation (`α = 0`)** — the clean baseline for `ΔLM` (zero by construction)
  and for norm (ratio ≈ 1).
- **Real-activation Mahalanobis (`D_M = 27.3`)** — the on-manifold reference line. A steered
  activation is "off-manifold" precisely when its `D_M` climbs above this.

A learned corrector (next iterations) will be judged on whether it lowers `D_M` and `ΔLM`
at a given steering strength **while preserving the projection of the edit along `v`**.

## Results

![off-manifold phenomenon](plots/01_offmanifold_phenomenon.png)

As steering strength `α` rises from 0 to 8, all three off-manifold measures increase
monotonically:

| α | Mahalanobis `D_M` | `|z|/|h|` | Δ LM loss (nats) |
|---|-------------------|-----------|------------------|
| 0 | 27.3 | 0.98 | 0.00 |
| 1 | 27.8 | 0.98 | +0.08 |
| 2 | 29.2 | 1.00 | +0.32 |
| 3 | 31.4 | 1.03 | +0.74 |
| 4 | 34.1 | 1.07 | +1.22 |
| 6 | 41.0 | 1.17 | +2.11 |
| 8 | 49.0 | 1.30 | +2.78 |

**Interpretation.** The damage is small at weak steering (`α ≤ 2`: `ΔLM < 0.35` nats,
`D_M` barely above the real-activation reference) but accelerates. By `α = 8` the steered
activation is ~1.8× as far from the real-activation cloud as a typical real activation is,
its norm is inflated by 30%, and the model's next-token loss is +2.78 nats worse — roughly a
**16× increase in perplexity**. This is exactly the regime where practitioners want strong
steering but where raw linear steering fails, and it is the regime where an on-manifold
corrector should help most.

## Conclusion

Raw linear activation steering in GPT-2 trades off strength against fluency in a sharp,
measurable way: the stronger the steer, the further off-manifold the activation and the
worse the language model behaves. We now have (i) a reproducible steering setup, (ii) a
fitted activation manifold model, and (iii) three metrics — Mahalanobis distance, norm
inflation, and ΔLM loss — that quantify the damage. The next step is a
**projection-preserving corrector** that keeps the steering projection intact while reducing
`D_M` and `ΔLM`:

```math
\hat{h} = z + P_{v^{\perp}}\, r_\theta(h, z, v, \alpha)
```

**Limitations.** (1) The manifold is modeled as a single Gaussian, so `D_M` captures
scale/correlation but not multimodal or nonlinear structure. (2) Off-manifold distance and
`ΔLM` are activation- and loss-level proxies; they do not yet measure downstream *concept
strength* or generated-text quality, which later iterations will add. (3) One layer, one
steering direction so far.
