# CHANGELOG — Direction: TODO — describe this direction

Append-only ledger of changes to RESULTS.md / REPORT.md. One dated entry per change: what changed,
why, and — if a result was superseded — the old -> new numbers. This is the ONLY place history lives;
RESULTS.md and REPORT.md themselves stay current-best with no history.

## 2026-08-10 — first results: S1+S2+S3 complete, hypothesis not supported

**RESULTS.md / REPORT.md:** both written from the placeholder templates to a full current-best
deliverable. Nothing superseded (first run), so no old -> new numbers.

New content:
- **S1 (tokenization + endpoint JSD).** All 5 prompt pairs (4 test + 1 control) validate in both
  `gpt2-medium` and `pythia-410m-deduped@step143000`: identical tokenized prefix, exactly one
  differing single final token. Endpoint JSD (nats) gpt2 / pythia — `Mary`/`her` 0.068 / 0.033;
  `four`/`4` 0.138 / 0.056; `four`/`Four` 0.377 / 0.271; `Au`/`79` 0.342 / 0.385;
  control `big`/`in` 0.659 / 0.665.
- **S2 (interpolation).** SLERP-direction + linear-norm interpolation of the block-0 `resid_post`
  at the final token, 101 alphas, patched forward. Harness identity check passes:
  |d(0)| <= 1e-4 and |d(1)-1| <= 1e-4 in all 10 cells. Final-logit w10-90 gpt2 / pythia —
  0.586 / 0.582; 0.454 / 0.758; 0.120 / 0.340; 0.358 / 0.598; control 0.516 / 0.425.
- **S3 (verdict).** Plateaus present in 9/10 cells (w_TV <= 0.27 vs linear 0.5) but endpoint
  similarity does not predict sharpness: pooled Spearman rho(JSD, w10-90) = -0.37 (p=0.29, n=10),
  rho(JSD, w_TV) = -0.15 (p=0.68), rho(JSD, PF) = +0.32 (p=0.37); sign flips between models
  (w_TV: +0.30 gpt2 vs -0.60 pythia). The control plateaus as sharply as the test pairs.

**Metric added beyond PLAN.md:** `w_TV` (alpha span carrying the middle 50% of the curve's total
variation; 0.5 for linear, ->0 for a step) and `PF` (plateau fraction). 4/10 curves are
non-monotonic, which inflates w10-90; w_TV is threshold-free and monotonicity-safe. w10-90 remains
the primary metric per PLAN.md.

**Figures added (all embedded in both deliverables):** `plots/final_logit_curves.png` (Fig 1, 5x2
raw d(alpha) curves + linear reference), `plots/jsd_vs_width.png` (Fig 2, JSD vs w10-90 and w_TV
with per-model Spearman), `plots/layerwise_widths.png` (Fig 3, w10-90 vs recording block).

**Framing (CLAUDE.md rule 9b):** the planned story ("similar continuations -> plateau") is not what
the evidence shows, so REPORT.md is built around the null and its practical consequence — a plateau
in a single-token interpolation needs a dissimilar-prompt control before it is evidence of anything,
because Figure 3 shows the sharpening is supplied by depth downstream of the patch.
