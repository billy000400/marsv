# RESULTS — What explains transition-width variation beyond successor JSD?

> CURRENT-BEST ONLY. No history (see CHANGELOG.md). Full definitions and interpretation: REPORT.md.

**Setting.** `pythia-1.4b-deduped` @ `step143000`, residual stream after block 0 at the final token
position, 1,000 token pairs from 123 endpoint tokens × 3 sentence frames × 50 interpolation steps
(pair artifacts inherited from `dir18`; the per-token probes, the forward screen and the anchor-set swap
are new inference on the same model and hook point, ~600k forward passes). Transition width `w` = fraction of the path over
which the output-distance score `d(t)` climbs from 0.1 to 0.9; smaller = narrower. Analyses run on the
**929 pairs** whose endpoint output movement is at least 0.2 bits in every frame.

## Headline

Beyond corpus successor JSD, transition width is mostly a **per-token additive property**: fitting one
number per token, with no interaction term, raises held-out $R^2$ from **0.149** (corpus JSD alone) to
**0.578**, against a reproducibility ceiling of **0.934**. The per-token term alone (0.365) beats both
corpus JSD (0.149) and the model's own endpoint output difference (0.187).

**And the per-token number can be measured, not just fitted.** Each token's width against **six anchor
tokens that appear in none of the 1,000 pairs** predicts its fitted effect at $\rho = +0.70$
($p = 5\times10^{-19}$); at the pair level two free parameters on $\hat w_u + \hat w_v$ reach held-out
$R^2 = 0.350$, matching the 123-parameter fit.

**Used as a screen it predicts pairs of tokens the analysis never saw.** For 40 tokens absent from the
bank, predicting all 780 of their pairs from anchor widths alone — slope and intercept frozen from the
bank, nothing fitted on the new tokens — gives $R^2 = 0.397$, $\rho = +0.66$, mean absolute error 0.047
on the 718 pairs that pass the gate, beating the model's own endpoint output difference on the same
pairs ($\rho = -0.51$).

**The trait is real; the measuring stick is not neutral.** Swapping the six anchors for six function
words or six rare content words still recovers the fitted token effect ($\rho = +0.57$ and $+0.61$),
but the two disjoint sets rank tokens at only $\rho = +0.46$ with each other — so $\hat w_u$ means
"width against this anchor set", and the anchor set must be reported with the method.

## Metrics

Held-out $R^2$ for `w`, 5-fold cross-validation over the 929 gated pairs, identical folds for every
model. The ordering is the direction's main result: every model containing the per-token term
$a_u + a_v$ beats every model without it, and the best pair-level-only model (five covariates plus
corpus JSD) still trails the token-additive model that uses no covariates at all.

| model of `w` | held-out $R^2$ |
|---|---|
| corpus successor JSD `J` | 0.149 |
| corpus JSD + quadratic term | 0.165 |
| model-output JSD $JSD_{\mathrm{out}}$ | 0.187 |
| 5 pair covariates + `J` (entropy, log-frequency, surprisal, $\cos_0$, $d_0$) | 0.399 |
| **token-additive** $\mu + a_u + a_v$ (no pair information) | **0.365** |
| **token-additive + `J`** | **0.578** |
| token-additive + `J` + $JSD_{\mathrm{out}}$ | 0.648 |
| token-additive + `J` + $JSD_{\mathrm{out}}$ + block-0 geometry | 0.723 |
| *reproducibility ceiling (across sentence frames)* | *0.934* |

Replacing the 123 fitted token effects by **measured** anchor widths — one number per token, obtained
from partners the bank never used — costs almost nothing, which is what turns the additive description
into a usable screen. The basin-radius probe, the mechanistic candidate, does much less well.

| model of `w` using measured per-token quantities | free parameters | held-out $R^2$ |
|---|---|---|
| **measured anchor width sum $\hat w_u + \hat w_v$** | **2** | **0.350** |
| *(for comparison: fitted token effects $a_u + a_v$)* | *123* | *0.365* |
| measured anchor width sum + `J` | 3 | 0.452 |
| basin-radius sum + `J` | 3 | 0.299 |
| output-entropy sum + `J` | 3 | 0.237 |

Forward screen — 40 tokens absent from the bank, all 780 pairs among them, slope and intercept frozen
from the bank so **no parameter is fitted on these tokens**. This is prediction, not fit, and it is the
result that makes the per-token screen an auditing tool rather than a description.

| forward screen on unseen tokens | value |
|---|---|
| pairs run / scored after gate and curve-validity | 780 / 718 |
| $R^2$ of the frozen screen on the new pairs | **0.397** |
| Spearman $\rho$ (screen vs observed `w`) | $+0.66$ ($p = 1.5\times10^{-89}$) |
| mean absolute error, on an observed `w` range of 0.34–0.78 | 0.047 |
| median observed `w` by predicted tercile | 0.50 / 0.57 / 0.62 |
| same pairs, baseline: model-output JSD (needs both endpoints of each pair) | $\rho = -0.51$ |

Anchor-set swap — the control on what the per-token measurement means. Two disjoint anchor sets rank
tokens only moderately alike, yet each recovers the same fitted token effect, so a common trait exists
and the anchor set is part of the method rather than a free choice.

| anchor set used to measure $\hat w_u$ | $\rho$ with fitted $a_u$ | held-out $R^2$ for pair `w` |
|---|---|---|
| mixed common words (` and`, ` significant`, ` close`, ` playing`, ` bigger`, ` buried`) | $+0.70$ | 0.350 |
| function words (` he`, ` it`, ` we`, ` but`, ` they`, ` them`) | $+0.57$ | 0.146 |
| rare content words (` surreal`, ` creepy`, ` unbelievable`, ` disgusting`, ` ironic`, ` tempting`) | $+0.61$ | 0.265 |
| *rank agreement between the two disjoint sets* | \- | $\rho = +0.46$ ($p = 1.0\times10^{-7}$) |

Layer sweep — the same per-token measurement with the interpolation site moved down the network. The
ranking of tokens survives; the transitions themselves flatten toward a proportional response, so the
sharpening is done by the blocks below the site.

| interpolation site | $\rho$ with block-0 $\hat w_u$ | $\rho$ with $a_u$ | median $\hat w_u$ | IQR across tokens | held-out $R^2$ for pair `w` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| block 0 | 1.00 | $+0.70$ | 0.553 | 0.102 | 0.350 |
| block 6 | $+0.92$ | $+0.59$ | 0.621 | 0.086 | 0.284 |
| block 12 | $+0.84$ | $+0.52$ | 0.728 | 0.065 | 0.214 |
| block 18 | $+0.72$ | $+0.35$ | 0.800 | 0.020 | 0.146 |

Supporting quantities. The first block says how strong the inherited association is on this subset,
the second says the leftover is neither noise nor a normalisation artifact, and the third says the
per-token effect cannot be looked up in a count table.

| quantity | value |
|---|---|
| $\rho(J, w)$, all 1,000 pairs | $-0.486$ ($p = 2.6\times10^{-60}$) |
| $\rho(J, w)$, 929 gated pairs | $-0.409$ ($p = 1.0\times10^{-38}$) |
| $\rho(JSD_{\mathrm{out}}, w)$, gated | $-0.357$ ($p = 3.1\times10^{-29}$) |
| matched narrow-vs-wide contrasts found (consistent in all 3 frames) | 1,529 (21 share a token) |
| largest matched contrast | ` her`/` when` $w{=}0.34$ vs ` kind`/` wrong` $w{=}0.77$ at $J = 0.70$ bits |
| across-frame agreement of additive-model residuals | $\bar r = 0.67$ (0.54 after adding geometry) |
| CV of `w` vs CV of $w \cdot d_0$ | 0.158 vs **0.216** — path-length artifact refuted |
| token effect $a_u$ vs **measured anchor width** $\hat w_u$ | $\rho = +0.70$ ($p = 4.6\times10^{-19}$; $+0.67$ with output entropy partialled out) |
| token effect $a_u$ vs corpus log-frequency | $\rho = -0.33$ ($p = 2.9\times10^{-4}$) |
| token effect $a_u$ vs continuation entropy | $\rho = -0.24$ ($p = 0.008$) |
| token effect $a_u$ vs model surprisal in frame | $\rho = +0.26$ ($p = 0.004$) |
| token effect $a_u$ vs basin radius, anchor directions ($\tau = 0.2$ bits) | $\rho = +0.39$ ($p = 1.1\times10^{-5}$) — sign opposite to the basin prediction |
| token effect $a_u$ vs basin radius, random directions ($\tau = 0.1$ bits) | $\rho = -0.02$ ($p = 0.87$) — no relation |

## Figures

The scatter that motivates the direction, and what the endpoint-movement gate removes:

![Width against corpus successor JSD, and against endpoint output movement](plots/scatter_and_gate.png)

**Figure 1.** Left: width `w` (y) against corpus successor JSD `J` in bits (x), all 1,000 pairs;
circles pass the movement gate, open squares fail it, black diamonds joined by lines are the eight
largest matched contrasts. Right: `w` (y) against endpoint output movement $JSD_{\mathrm{out}}$ in bits
(x), dashed line = the 0.2-bit gate. Gated-out pairs cluster at high `w`: a normalised score cannot
describe a movement that barely happened.

Matched contrasts differ in the shape of the curve, not in how far the output travels:

![Output-distance curves for three matched narrow-vs-wide contrasts](plots/contrast_curves.png)

**Figure 2.** `d(t)` (y) against interpolation position `t` (x) for three matched contrasts, all three
frames per pair. Solid = narrow pair, dashed = wide pair; the two pairs in each panel are matched on
`J` and on $JSD_{\mathrm{out}}$ (panel titles). Dotted lines at $d = 0.1$ and $d = 0.9$ bound `w`.

Which model of `w` predicts held-out pairs best — the direction's core question:

![Held-out R-squared for models of transition width](plots/cv_r2.png)

**Figure 3.** Held-out $R^2$ (x) for seven models of `w` (y). Hatched = pair-level predictors only,
solid = includes the per-token term. Dashed line = the 0.934 reproducibility ceiling.

The gain is a shift of the whole distribution, not a few pairs:

![Predicted versus observed width for two models](plots/prediction.png)

**Figure 4.** Observed `w` (y) against held-out predicted `w` (x), corpus JSD alone (left, squares) and
corpus JSD plus the per-token term (right, circles); dashed line $y = x$. Corpus JSD compresses all
predictions into 0.47–0.67 and never reaches the narrow tail.

What the per-token effect is, and what it is not:

![Fitted per-token width effects, and their relation to corpus frequency](plots/token_effects.png)

**Figure 5.** Left: fitted token effect $a_u$ in width units (y) for the 120 tokens used in at least
four gated pairs, ranked (x), extremes labelled — ` un`, ` in`, ` his`, ` my` pull narrow, ` kind`,
` real`, ` now` push wide. Right: $a_u$ (y) against corpus log-frequency (x); the relation is real but
loose, so frequency is not the underlying variable.

Does the per-token trait survive contact with the model, and is the basin picture behind it?

![Anchor width against fitted token effect, basin radius against fitted token effect, and held-out R-squared](plots/transfer.png)

**Figure 6.** Left: fitted token effect $a_u$ (y) against measured anchor width $\hat w_u$ (x, median
width against six tokens used in no pair) — the transfer test, $\rho = +0.70$. Middle: $a_u$ (y)
against basin radius (x, radians of great-circle travel before the output moves $\tau$ bits); squares
= directions toward anchor tokens ($\tau = 0.2$), triangles = random directions ($\tau = 0.1$). Right:
held-out $R^2$ for pair width (x) for five models (y); hatched = corpus JSD, solid = measured token
widths, dotted = fitted token effects.

Does the screen hold up on tokens the analysis never saw?

![Forward prediction of pair width for unseen tokens, and separation by predicted tercile](plots/forward_screen.png)

**Figure 7.** Left: observed `w` (y) of 718 pairs built from 40 tokens absent from the bank, against the
width predicted from the two tokens' anchor widths alone (x); slope and intercept come from the bank,
so nothing is fitted here. Dashed line $y = x$. Right: observed `w` (y) by tercile of the screen's
prediction (x); boxes are median, quartiles and 1.5 IQR whiskers, hatched distinctly per tercile.

Can the anchor tokens be swapped freely, or is the measuring stick part of the result?

![Anchor width under two disjoint anchor sets, and each set's agreement with the fitted token effect](plots/anchor_swap.png)

**Figure 8.** Left: anchor width against six rare content words (y) versus anchor width against six
function words (x), one marker per endpoint token, extremes of the fitted effect labelled. Right:
Spearman $\rho$ between each anchor set's widths and the fitted token effect $a_u$ (y) for the three
anchor sets (x). The sets agree only in part with each other, yet each recovers the same trait.

Where does the trait come from, and what does depth contribute?

![Anchor width measured at blocks 0, 6, 12 and 18](plots/layer_sweep.png)

**Figure 9.** Left: Spearman $\rho$ across the 123 tokens (y) against the interpolation block (x);
solid/circles = agreement with block-0 anchor widths, dashed/squares = agreement with the fitted token
effect $a_u$. Right, same x-axis: median anchor width (solid, circles), held-out $R^2$ for the block-0
pair widths (dashed, diamonds), and the interquartile range of $\hat w_u$ across tokens (dotted,
triangles); the dash-dotted line is $w = 0.8$, a perfectly proportional response.

## Next experiment

**Is the trait in the embedding?** Measure anchor widths with the interpolation site at the input
embedding, and fit a linear probe from a token's static embedding to its $\hat w_u$ on 80 of the 123
tokens, testing on the rest. If the probe recovers the ranking, the screen costs a lookup instead of a
forward pass; if not, the trait lives in how frame and token combine at block 0. Under half an hour.
